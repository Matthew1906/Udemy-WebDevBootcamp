# Web Development Bootcamp

Hello there, I'm Matthew Adrianus Mulyono.

A long time ago, I decided to take the Web Development Bootcamp Course by Angela Yu on Udemy.

Course link: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/ 

I took this course to learn web development and expand my portofolio.

This repository contain most of my notes and projects while trying to complete this course because the basic HTML & CSS are the same with the ones taught in the [100 Days of Python](https://github.com/Matthew1906/100DaysOfPython) course.

Feel free to see my projects and exercises, The finished projects are listed below.

Thanks for visiting this repository!

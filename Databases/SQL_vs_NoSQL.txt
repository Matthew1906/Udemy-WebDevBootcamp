SQL: Structured Query Language
-> also called as relational database
-> examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL
-> old fashioned (mature, lots of docs) and structured (schema)
-> structure: tables
-> good at relationships between data (tables)
-> scalability: low (vertical)
-> There are no projects with SQL (it was discussed tho)

NOSQL: Not only SQL
-> also called as non-relational database
-> examples: mongoDB, redis
-> kinda new (lots of updates) and flexible
-> structure: documents
	=> one example would be using JSON, more flexible
-> bad at complex relationships (between data)
-> scalability: high (horizontal)
